# TTV_review
Chapter for Springer's Exoplanet Handbook on TTV/TDV

exoplanet_eu.dat:  
Downloaded m < 25 M_earth planets with radius measurements from exoplanet.eu on 10/7/2016
Total of 157 planets.  Discarded planets for which lower limit is < 2-sigma from zero.
Left with 76 planets.  Had to look up parameters & uncertainties for some - used NeXScI
(http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) & reference papers (found via
exoplanet.eu).  Main mass refs. are Marcy et al., Hadden & Lithwick, etc.

This matches the number in Jontof-Hutter's table as well, which are in the file planet_mr.txt

J-F misses GJ 1132, BD+20 594 b, -20d, -21b, -23b, -56b, -80bcde, -102d -113 -114
eu misses 289-b [ ], K2-38 (aka EPIC 204221263) [ ], Kepler-4b [ ], Kepler-10c [ ], -11b,c (<2-sig), -18b (<2-sig), -33def [ ]
  -89c [ ],  -98b [ ], -99b [ ], -106c [ ], K2-19c [ ], Corot-22b [ ]

So there should be a total of ~89 planets!

Both the HARPS & Keck teams clamin that K2-3d is affected by stellar variability.  Density is
abnormally high, so we'll eliminate this one.

So, now I need to figure out how to make Dan's plot. [ ]
